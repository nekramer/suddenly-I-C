# suddenly-I-C
A repository to hold scripts in my quest to learn C! These are projects
taken from the Codecademy course "Learn C".

## Scripts
### anagrams.c
A program to determine whether two strings are anagrams or not. Input
strings can only contain characters that are from the first four letters
of the English alphabet (a, b, c, and d) and spaces. All letters must be lowercase 
and spaces are not counted.

### dates.c
Utilizes `switch` statement logic to convert a date from mm/dd/yyyy format 
into an English derived system with full month names and suffixed dates.

### fizzbuzz.c
A program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100. Prints `Fizz` for multipiles of 3,
`Buzz` for multiples of 5, and `FizzBuzz` for multiples of 3 and 5.

### groceryStore_1.c
Practice with variables by putting together and displaying information
about apples in a grocery store.

### groceryStore_2.c
Expanding on `groceryStore_1.c` to add more information, apply sales, and
modify the review score of apples in a grocery store.

### mini_calendar.cc
A mini-calendar program that determines new dates relative to
older dates. This logic follows the Gregorian Calendar

### race_simulator.c
A program to exercise the use of structures to create a race
simulator.

### stringCopy.c
An implementation of the `strcpy()` function from the 
`string.h` library.
